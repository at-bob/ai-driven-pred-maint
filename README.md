üìÇ Model Architecture Exploration - IEP Branch
=================================================

Welcome to the **Model Architecture Exploration** branch of our GitHub repository! 
This branch is dedicated to showcasing our experimentation and evaluation process 
as we explored various model architectures for our Internal Endpoint (IEP) solutions 
before finalizing the optimal design.

-------------------------------------------------
üìÑ Included Files
-------------------------------------------------

1. **anomaly-detection-for-time-series-sensor-data.ipynb**
   - This Jupyter Notebook documents our approach to building and testing different 
     anomaly detection models tailored for time-series sensor data. It includes 
     feature engineering, model selection trials, and evaluation metrics.

2. **engine-failure-detection-and-analysis.ipynb**
   - This notebook focuses on failure detection techniques, comparing multiple ML models 
     to identify potential engine failures based on sensor input data. It highlights 
     our experimentation with classifiers, preprocessing strategies, and performance analysis.

3. **engine_failure_dataset.csv**
   - This is the dataset used throughout our exploration phase. It contains time-series 
     sensor readings along with labeled conditions for both anomaly detection and failure prediction tasks.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** In professional practice, datasets like this should be handled securely and kept out 
     of version control systems. It is included here strictly for demonstration purposes within this branch.

üéØ Purpose of This Branch
-------------------------------------------------

This branch exists to:
- Document our **model exploration journey**.
- Showcase alternative architectures and methods we tested for both anomaly detection and failure prediction.
- Provide transparency on why we selected specific models for deployment in our final IEP solutions.

The finalized, production-ready models are available in the `main` branch. 
This branch remains as a reference for learning, collaboration, and future improvements.
